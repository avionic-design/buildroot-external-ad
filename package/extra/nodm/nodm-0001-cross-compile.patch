+.SH NAME
+nodm \- X display manager for automatic logins
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B nodm
+[\fI\,options\/\fR]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\fBnodm\fP is a minimal display manager that simply logs in as a given user and
+starts an X session, without asking for username or password.
+.P
+On a normal computer, using \fBnodm\fP is a big security issue because it would
+give anyone access to the computer.
+.P
+However, there are cases where automatic login is needed: for example in an
+embedded system such as a mobile phone, or in a kiosk setup, or in a control
+panel for industrial machinery.  For those cases, \fBnodm\fP is simple to
+setup, lightweight, and it should do exactly the right thing.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+\fB\-\-help\fR
+print this help message
+.TP
+\fB\-\-version\fR
+print nodm's version number
+.TP
+\fB\-\-session\fR=\fI\,cmd\/\fR
+run cmd instead of \fI\,/usr/local/sbin/nodm\/\fP
+(use for testing)
+.SH AUTHOR
+\fBnodm\fP is written and maintained by Enrico Zini <enrico@enricozini.org> and
