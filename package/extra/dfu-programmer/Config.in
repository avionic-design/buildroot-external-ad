	  dfu-programmer is a multi-platform command-line programmer for Atmel
	  (8051, AVR, XMEGA & AVR32) chips with a USB bootloader supporting ISP.
	  Most Atmel devices having a USB port come pre-programmed with the
	  bootloader, and this is a lightweight alternative to Atmel's own
	  FLIP/BatchISP program. This is a mostly Device Firmware Update (DFU)
	  1.0 compliant user-space application.
