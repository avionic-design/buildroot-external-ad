	  Irqbalance is a daemon to help balance the cpu load generated
	  by interrupts across all of a systems cpus.
	  Irqbalance identifies the highest volume interrupt sources,
	  and isolates them to a single unique cpu, so that load is
	  spread as much as possible over an entire processor set, while
	  minimizing cache hit rates for irq handlers.

	  The standard upstream package is broken on ARM; this package
	  is a fork that's working on that platform.
