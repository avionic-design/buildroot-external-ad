	  Some programs still link using the legacy -lpng12 version
	  of libpng for handling PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
	  images. It is still maintained for security fixes so
	  make it available, but do not select this unless you
	  have an application that explicitly needs the older
	  libpng12 functionality. Use libpng instead.
