buildroot-external-ad
=====================

Buildroot external overlay for Avionic Design Meerkat-based systems. Contains
support for building a root-filesystem including Linux4Tegra binary driver
support.

For l4t compatibility buildroot-2014.05 has to be used as base, as later
buildroot releases contain components (especially Xorg) in newer version than
l4t supports.
